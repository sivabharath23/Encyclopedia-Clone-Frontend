                            <p>An <b>encyclopedia</b> (American English) or encyclopædia (British English) is a reference work or
                            compendium providing summaries of knowledge either general or special to a particular field or
                            discipline.[1][2] Encyclopedias are divided into articles or entries that are arranged alphabetically by 
                            article name[3] or by thematic categories, or else are hyperlinked and searchable.[4] Encyclopedia entries
                            are longer and more detailed than those in most dictionaries.[3][5] Generally speaking, encyclopedia articles 
                            focus on factual information concerning the subject named in the article's title;[5] this is unlike
                            dictionary entries, which focus on linguistic information about words, such as their etymology, meaning, 
                            pronunciation, use, and grammatical forms.[5][6][7][8][9]
                            Encyclopedias have existed for around 2,000 years, and have evolved considerably during that time as regards
                            language (written in a major international or a vernacular language), size (few or many volumes), intent 
                            (presentation of a global or a limited range of knowledge), cultural perspective (authoritative, ideological,
                            didactic, utilitarian), authorship (qualifications, style), readership (education level, background, interests,
                            capabilities), and the technologies available for their production and distribution (hand-written manuscripts, 
                            small or large print runs, Internet). As a valued source of reliable information compiled by experts, printed 
                            versions found a place in libraries, schools and other educational institutions.

                            <p>The word encyclopedia (encyclo|pedia) comes from the Koine Greek ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία,[12] transliterated enkyklios<br>
                                paideia, meaning 'general education' from enkyklios (ἐγκύκλιος), meaning 'circular, recurrent, required regularly, general'[5][13] and paideia (παιδεία), meaning 'education, rearing of a child'; together, the phrase literally translates as 'complete instruction' or 'complete knowledge'.[14] However, the two separate words were reduced to a single word due to a scribal error[15] by copyists of a Latin manuscript edition of Quintillian in 1470.[16] The copyists took this phrase to be a single Greek word, enkyklopaedia, with the same meaning, and this spurious Greek word became the Neo-Latin word encyclopaedia, which in turn came into English. Because of this compounded word, fifteenth-century readers and since have often, and incorrectly, thought that the Roman authors Quintillian and Pliny described an ancient genre.[17]

                            <p>The modern encyclopedia was developed from the dictionary in the 18th century. Historically, both encyclopedias and dictionaries have been researched and written by well-educated, well-informed content experts, but they are significantly different in structure. A dictionary is a linguistic work which primarily focuses on alphabetical listing of words and their definitions. Synonymous words and those related by the subject matter are to be found scattered around the dictionary, giving no obvious place for in-depth treatment. Thus, a dictionary typically provides limited information, analysis or background for the word defined. While it may offer a definition, it may leave the reader lacking in understanding the meaning, significance or limitations of a term, and how the term relates to a broader field of knowledge.
                                To address those needs, an encyclopedia article is typically not limited to simple definitions, and is not limited to defining an individual word, but provides a more extensive meaning for a subject or discipline. In addition to defining and listing synonymous terms for the topic, the article is able to treat the topic's more extensive meaning in more depth and convey the most relevant accumulated knowledge on that subject. An encyclopedia article also often includes many maps and illustrations, as well as bibliography and statistics.[5] An encyclopedia is, theoretically, not written in order to convince, although one of its goals is indeed to convince its reader of its own veracity.
